## REACT-CANVAS

We have used javascript based open source application with React and Konva HTML5 canvas library. The goal is to have similar declarative markup as normal React and to have similar data-flow model.
React Konva is a JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using React.
It adds the ability for React components to render to react rather than DOM. Actually you don't need to learn react-konva. Just learn Konva framework, you will understand how to use react-konva Core API:
React-konva supports all shapes, that Konva supports with the same names, and also it supports all the same events like click, touchmove, dragend, etc with "on" prefix like onClick, onTouchMove, onDragEnd.

## Dependencies:

- konva
- React- Hooks
- React-color
- React-dropzone
- React-konva

## Upcoming Upgradations:

Enable users to Sign up and make a new profile,
Save button to allow users save their customised Tshirt,
Adding payment section.
Support rotation of texts and stickers.

## How to use:

- Clone the repo to your local machine.
- Run npm install in the root directory,
- Run npm install react-konva konva --save
- Run npm start to run the webpack server.
- Visit localhost:3000 to check out the website!
