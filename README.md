# DeSherT Design

An attempt of this project is to design and customise your Tshirt by adding texts, Photos, Stickers, drawing on the Tshirt as well as changing and resizing the colors of the Tshirt,Text and drawing.

## REACT-CANVAS

We have used javascript based open source application with React and Konva HTML5 canvas library. The goal is to have similar declarative markup as normal React and to have similar data-flow model.
React Konva is a JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using React.
It adds the ability for React components to render to react rather than DOM. Actually you don't need to learn react-konva. Just learn Konva framework, you will understand how to use react-konva Core API:
React-konva supports all shapes, that Konva supports with the same names, and also it supports all the same events like click, touchmove, dragend, etc with "on" prefix like onClick, onTouchMove, onDragEnd.

## Dependencies:

- konva
- React- Hooks
- React-color
- React-dropzone
- React-konva

## Upcoming Upgradations:

Enable users to Sign up and make a new profile,
Save button to allow users save their customised Tshirt,
Adding payment section.
Support rotation of texts and stickers.

## How to use:

- Clone the repo to your local machine.
- Run npm install in the root directory,
- Run npm install react-konva konva --save
- Run npm start to run the webpack server.
- Visit localhost:3000 to check out the website!

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
